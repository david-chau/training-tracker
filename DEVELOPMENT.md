# Development

For working on the code. If you only want to get a log running, use the
[setup guide](https://david-chau.github.io/training-tracker/setup.html) instead —
it is browser-only and needs none of this.

Design decisions, constraints, and the traps already hit live in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Layout

```
src/Code.gs        server logic — reads, writes, the progression rule
src/Index.html     the entire UI (a template, uses <?= ?>)
src/appsscript.json  manifest
data/build_template.py       seed data + the .xlsx generator
docs/              the GitHub Pages site
docs/download/training-tracker-template.xlsx   generated; what users import
```

## Pushing code with clasp

Apps Script has no local runtime, so everything is tested against a live
sheet. Use a scratch copy of a spreadsheet, never one in real use.

```bash
npm install -g @google/clasp
clasp login
```

Get the script ID from the sheet: **Extensions → Apps Script → Project
Settings → Script ID**.

Write it into a `.clasp.json` at the repo root — gitignored, since it points
at one specific person's spreadsheet:

```json
{ "scriptId": "PASTE_IT_HERE", "rootDir": "src" }
```

`rootDir` matters: the manifest and both source files live in `src/`, and
clasp pushes from wherever it is told to look.

```bash
clasp push
clasp deploy --description "initial"
```

Day to day:

```bash
clasp push --watch     # push on save
clasp open             # open the editor in a browser
```

A deployment serves the version it was created with. After `clasp push`,
either `clasp deploy` again or edit the existing deployment in the editor
(**Deploy → Manage deployments → pencil → Version: New version**), otherwise
the published URLs keep serving the old code.

## The spreadsheet template

`docs/download/training-tracker-template.xlsx` is generated, and lives under
`docs/` so GitHub Pages serves it — the setup guide links straight at it, so
there is only ever one copy. The seed exercise list and day templates live as
plain Python lists at the top of `data/build_template.py`, which is also the
only human-diffable copy of them.

```bash
python3 data/build_template.py     # stdlib only, no dependencies
```

It writes the `.xlsx` and then re-reads it, asserting the tab names, the nine
`Log` headings, and that numeric template values were written as numbers. A
failed assertion means the file would have been broken on import.

## Log schema

Nine columns. **`Code.gs` reads them by position, not by heading**, so the
order is load-bearing — changing it means changing `COL` and `WIDTH` in
`Code.gs` and `LOG` in `build_template.py` together.

```
A Date | B Day | C Exercise | D Set | E Reps | F Weight (LB) | G RPE
H Auto note | I Notes
```

Column H is written by the generator (`from template`, `was easy`, `repeat`,
`backed off`). Column I is the admin's free text. They are separate on
purpose.

## Testing

There is no test suite. The manual loop, against a scratch sheet:

1. **Training → Delete this day** — wipe the session under test.
2. Start a **Custom** session → confirm it opens empty, that adding one
   exercise persists it, and that reloading before adding anything returns
   the Start button.
3. Pick a day type → **Start session** → confirm it builds from the template
   or from last week.
4. Change values → confirm the status bar reports the actual row number and
   the values read back out of the sheet.
5. Open the bare `/exec` URL → confirm everything is read-only.

Test any change to the steppers at 390px wide. The ± buttons have eaten the
input width before now, and `8.5` rendered as `.5`.
